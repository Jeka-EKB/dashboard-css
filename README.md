# Dashboard CSS

A small CSS framework for dashboard and control applications. Great for web-based IoT projects.

Produces a full-width page of "panels" arranged on a responsive grid. Each panel contains output information and/or control form elements.

Here's a demo. (TODO)

## Why

I often run a web server on Raspberry PIs, usually to view data or expose some rudimentary controls to my smartphone or laptop via the browser. I couldn't find an existing CSS framework that quite suited my needs, so I built this one.

## Design goals

- Only 1 minified file
- No externally-loaded dependencies
- Semantic HTML just works where appropriate
- Limit browser support to avoid hacks

## Development

    gem install scss-lint
    npm install
    gulp serve

## TODO

- Installation (general, npm)
- Contribution instructions
- Development instructions
- CI
- Documentation

## Contributing

- TODO
- SCSS style guide (http://sass-guidelin.es/)
